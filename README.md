## Note
1. The units displayed don't affect the calculation results. it's just a view.
2. Available shapes :
   - Plane geometry
        - rectangle
        - square
        - triangle (included pythagorean)
   - Solid geometry
        - cube
        - rectangle prism
        - sphere
3. Other geometry shapes are under development
